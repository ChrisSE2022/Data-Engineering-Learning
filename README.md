                      DATA ENGINEERING LEARNING

What Is Data Engineering?
Data Engineering is the heart of designing, building, collecting, storing, processing, and analyzing large amounts of data at a scale.
The aim of data engineering is to make quality data available for analysis and efficient data-driven decision making
The Data Engineering ecosystem consists of 4 things:-
 
Data — different data types, formats, and sources of data.
Data stores and repositories — Relational and non-relational databases, data warehouses, data marts, data lakes, and big data stores that store and process the data
Data Pipelines — Collect/Gather data from multiple sources, clean, process and transform it into data which can be used for analysis,
Analytics and Data-driven Decision Making — Make the well-processed data available for further business analytics, visualization and data-driven decision making.
 
Roles Of a Data Engineer
A data engineer involves working with different types of data formats
A data engineer is often required to use APIs to retrieve data from databases
Obtain data from different sources but also process it.
